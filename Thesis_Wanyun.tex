粒子物理学的标准模型是一个成功的理论，为理解宇宙中的基本力和粒子提供了全面的框架。它描述了电磁、弱和强相互作用，并描述了一系列基本粒子，如夸克、轻子和希格斯玻色子。尽管标准模型在解释许多粒子物理学方面取得了巨大的成功，但它也有其局限性。例如，暗物质和中微子质量等现象在标准模型中仍然无法解释。这些局限性激发了对标准模型之外新物理（BSM）的探索。

量子色动力学（QCD）是标准模型的关键组成部分，是描述强相互作用的理论。这种相互作用将夸克和胶子（构成质子、中子和其他强子的基本成分）结合在一起。在大型强子对撞机等高能碰撞中，根据QCD理论，夸克和胶子被散射后会强子化，形成喷注，从而能被探测器记录下来。

准确区分夸克喷注和胶子喷注对于理解粒子物理学中的许多过程至关重要。然而，由于强子化的原因，区分起源于夸克的喷注和起源于胶子的喷注是一个重大的挑战。本博士论文中呈现的物理分析旨在利用ATLAS探测器在2015至2018年间收集的数据，对标准模型之外的双喷注不变质量分布中的新共振进行搜索。许多BSM新物理模型预测粒子可能衰变成一对胶子，本分析旨在寻找衰变成两个喷注的BSM共振的证据，并采用了一种基于与喷注相关的带电轨迹分析的专门胶子标记方法，以提高探测新共振的能力。

本分析中区分夸克和胶子喷注的过程（通常称为夸克/胶子标记）具有重要意义。本文研究了两种夸克/胶子喷注标记器的性能和校准：一种基于与喷注相关的带电轨迹数量（\ntrk）的标记器，另一种则采用增强决策树（BDT）算法来结合各种喷注次级结构观测量。在500至1200 GeV 喷注横向动量范围内，BDT标记器在区分夸克喷注和胶子喷注方面的表现优于\ntrk~标记器。在高于此能级范围上，两种标记器的表现相当。同时对于500 GeV至2 TeV的喷注横向动量范围内，提供了数据与蒙特卡洛模拟之间夸克喷注标记效率的差异。在不同标记器工作点，其差异范围在0.92至1.02之间，包括大约 20\%的系统误差。该误差主要受到理论建模的影响。在数据上运用矩阵方法，从两个富含夸克/胶子地子样本中提取真实的夸克/胶子喷注比例，该 样本由喷注的赝快度定义。

在分析中，通过参数化双喷注不变质量谱，估算了QCD本底。定义了三种不同的谱：未标记的双喷注不变质量、一个胶子标记（1-$g$标记）和两个胶子标记（2-$g$标记）的信号道，用于搜寻BSM模型的引力子和量子黑洞（QBH）。由于没有观察到与本底明显的偏差，因此在三个类别中为BSM信号模型设置了95\%置信水平（CL）的截面上限。引力子质量的观测下限为3.81 TeV（未标记）、4.01 TeV（1-$g$标记）和4.26 TeV（2-$g$标记）。对于QBH模型，质量的观测下限为9.88 TeV（未标记）、9.89 TeV（1-$g$标记），以及高于10.00 TeV（2-$g$标记）的95\% CL。尤其在高横向动量下，胶子标记后的搜索敏感性增强了5\%，为所考虑的BSM信号提高了搜索限制。在未来的研究中，该标记器有极大潜能提高标准模型的测量精细度，以及寻找超标准模型的敏感度。

The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics is a successful theory that provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the fundamental forces and particles in the universe. It describes the electromagnetic, weak, and strong nuclear interactions, and includes a range of elementary particles like quarks, leptons, and the Higgs boson. Despite its huge success in explaining many aspects of particle physics, the SM has its limitations. There are various phenomena, such as dark matter and neutrino masses, that remain unexplained within the SM. These limitations motivates a quest for new physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM).

Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is a pivotal component of the SM, representing the theory that describes the strong interaction. This interaction is responsible for binding quarks and gluons, the basic constituents of protons, neutrons, and other hadrons. In high-energy collisions, such as those in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), QCD dynamics play a critical role. When quarks and gluons are scattered by collisions, they hadronised as jet and recorded by the detector.

Quark and gluon jets are central to understanding many processes within particle physics. However, distinguishing between a jet originating from a quark and one from a gluon presents a significant challenge due to the hadronisation. The physics analyses presented in this PhD dissertation search for new BSM physics in the dijet mass distribution using an integrated luminosity of 140 \ifb of proton-proton collisions with a centre-of-mass energy at 13 TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector from the LHC. Many BSM models of new physics predict the particles could decay into a pair of gluons, this analysis aims at searching for the evidence of the BSM resonances that decay into two jets, with a specialized gluon-tagging approach adopted. This method hinges on the analysis of the charged tracks associated with a jet, to enhance the ability to detect new resonances .

The process of distinguishing jets arising from quarks and gluons, commonly known as quark/gluon tagging, is pivotal in this analysis. Thus the performance and the calibration of two quark/gluon jet taggers is studied: one tagger based on the number of charged tracks associated with the jets (\ntrk), while the other employs a boosted decision tree (BDT) to combine various jet substructure observables. The BDT-tagger outperformed the \ntrk-tagger in distinguishing quark-jets from gluon-jets up to 1200 GeV \pt, with both taggers showing comparable performance above this range.  Differences between data and Monte Carlo simulation of quark-jet tagging efficiency are provided for jet transverse momenta ranging from 500 GeV to 2 TeV, encompassing various tagger working points, range between 0.92 and 1.02. These come with a combined systematic uncertainty of about 20\%, predominantly caused by theoretical modelling uncertainty. A matrix method is performed on data to retrieve the quark/gluon fraction from quark/gluon-enriched subsamples, defined by the pseudorapidity of the jet. 

In the analysis, the QCD background is estimated by the statistical framework which parametrised the dijet mass spectrum. Three different spectra are defined: the untagged dijet invariant mass, one gluon-tagged (1-$g$ tagged) and two gluon-tagged (2-$g$ tagged) channels for BSM signal Graviton and Quantum Black Hole (QBH) models. Because no significant deviation is observed, an upper limits for the cross-section then are set at the 95\% confidence level (CL) for the three categories on signal models of BSM physics. The observed lower limits for Graviton mass were 3.81 TeV (untagged), 4.01 TeV (1-$g$ tagged), and 4.26 TeV (2-$g$ tagged). For the QBH model, the limits were 9.88 TeV (untagged), 9.89 TeV (1-$g$ tagged), and above 10.00 TeV (2-$g$ tagged) at 95\% CL. Gluon tagging, enhanced by 5\% per tagged gluon, especially at high \pt. By incorporating gluon-tagging on event selections, the search limits are improved for BSM signals considered.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:1}


\hspace{8mm}
Over the past seventy years, thousands of physicists have developed a notable insight into the fundamental structure of matters, known as fundamental particles, and the interactions they undergo through four fundamental forces. One of the best understandings of how these particles and three of the forces interact with each other is encapsulated in the Standard Model (SM)~\cite{ref1,ref8} of particle physics. Developed in the early 1970s, it has been successfully proved by almost all experimental results. The huge success of the discovery of Higgs Boson in 2012 predicted by the SM was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2013. The SM has become established as a well-tested physics theory.

Although the SM accurately describes the phenomena within its domain, there are still theoretical flaws that prevent some fundamental physical phenomena from being fully explained by the SM. First of all, the model contains many parameters that cannot be derived from calculations alone but must be determined by experiment. 
In 1998, the Japanese Super-Kamiokande neutrino detector published results on neutrino oscillations that suggested the neutrinos have a non-zero rest mass, This groundbreaking finding, which deviates from the predictions of the SM, has profound implications for our understanding of the universe. It suggests that the SM, as it currently stands, might be an incomplete description of the fundamental constituents and forces of nature. Furthermore, two of the most intriguing and elusive concepts in modern physics - gravity and dark matter - remain  absent from the SM. Gravity, one of the fundamental forces, is not accounted for in the SM, a limitation that has led physicists to explore BSM theories. The presence of dark matter, inferred from astrophysical observations,  indicating the necessity for new physics to explain these unaccounted-for aspects of the universe.

Many models of physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM)~\cite{ref9} predict the presence of new particles that couple to quarks and/or gluons. Such particles could be produced in proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)~\cite{Evans:2008zzb} and then decay into quarks and gluons, during this process two hadronic jets are created, which then can be seen by the detector. The new energy regime ($\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV) with an integrated luminosity of 140 \ifb provided by the LHC opens a window to search for BSM particles. 

This thesis explores potential BSM physics by examining the two-jet (dijet) invariant mass (\mjj) distribution, detecting BSM resonances that result in dijet decay. Given that some new resonances might decay predominantly into gluons, a gluon-tagging technique, which considers associated charged tracks within a jet, has been utilized, classified the search regions into untagged, 1-gluon($g$) tagged and 2-$g$ tagged regions. A critical aspect of this work is the quark/gluon tagging, a process that differentiates jets initiated by quarks from those by gluons. This research evaluates the effectiveness of two quark/gluon tagging methods: one assessing the number of charged tracks linked with jets and the other using a boosted decision tree that integrates multiple jet substructure variables. Discrepancies between actual data and Monte Carlo (MC) simulation for tagger efficiency are documented for jet transverse momenta between 500 GeV and 2 TeV across diverse tagger working points. Employing a matrix method on the collected data, the quark/gluon composition is extracted from subsamples enriched in quark or gluon content, determined by jet pseudorapidity.

In the SM, these dijet events are generated mainly by quantum chromodynamic (QCD) processes and appeared to be a smoothly decreasing \mjj distribution, however, a new particle that decays into quarks or gluons could appear as a resonance in the \mjj spectrum. If the resonant samples can be classified based on the type of parton that initiated the jets, the sensitivity of the search for such resonances could be largely increased. Hence, classifying jets as initiated from a quark or a gluon can be effective for improving SM measurements and searches for BSM physics. 

Recent developments~\cite{CMS:2021iwu,ref22,CMS:2017yer,CMS:2013kfv,CMS:2017pcy,PhysRevD.98.092014,CMS:2018vzn,Altheimer:2012mn,Andersen:2016qtm,Larkoski:2014pca,CDF:2005prv,OPAL:1999jkz,CLEO:2007tqf,DELPHI:1999gah,ZEUS:2004gcp,ref24,Komiske:2016rsd} in quark/gluon ($q/g$) tagging have resulted from advances in the theoretical~\cite{ref16}, phenomenological~\cite{ref17, ref18, Gras:2017jty, Komiske:2018vkc} and experimental understanding of $q/g$ tagging as well as the development of powerful machine learning techniques that can utilize the entire jet internal radiation pattern. The calibration of $q/g$ taggers is performed to account for the systematics of searching results. 


This thesis is structured as follows. Chapter \ref{sec:2}. describes the theoretical framework of the SM, its limitations and various potential extensions beyond it. An introduction to the LHC and the ATLAS detector is given in Chapter \ref{sec:3}. Jet reconstructions and calibrations are briefly described in Chapter \ref{sec:4}. The quark/gluon tagger definitions and the selection criteria used to generate the various event samples employed in the discriminant extraction, the method and the scale factor results are presented in Chapter \ref{sec:5}. The details of the search for new resonances in the dijet spectrum and the limit setting results are shown in Chapter \ref{sec:6}. In the end, the conclusion and outlook of the research are presented in Chapter \ref{sec:7}.

\section{The theory framework}
\label{sec:2}
\subsection{The Standard Model}
\label{sec:2.1}

The SM of particle physics, which describes the three fundamental interactions - strong, weak and electromagnetic interactions, alongside the elemental constituents that constitute all forms of matter,emerges as an unparalleled triumph in the scientific quest to decode the universe's most fundamental aspects. 
The SM divides particles into two categories, fermions and bosons, based on the values of their spin: fermions are the particles that makeup matter, such as electrons in leptons, quarks and neutrinos, which have half-integer spin; bosons are the particles that transmit forces, such as photons and mesons that transmit electromagnetic forces, gluons that transmit strong nuclear forces, $W$ and $Z$ that transmit weak nuclear forces, have integer spin.  Different properties shown in fermions and bosons are due to the difference in spin. According to the spin-statistics theorem, fermions obey the Pauli exclusion principle, whereas bosons do not, thus bosons do not have a theoretical limit on their spatial density. All particles and forces with their masses, charges and spines are summarised in Figure~\ref{fig:SM}.

	\includegraphics[width=14cm]{./fig/SM-p.png}
	\caption{The Standard Model of particle physics~\cite{lbnl}}
	\label{fig:SM}
\end{figure}

The SM  serves as an exemplar of a quantum field theory, offering the mathematical underpinning for such a framework. The Lagrangian controlled the dynamics and kinematics of the system satisfies the $SU(3)$ x $SU(2)$$_L$ x $U(1)$$_Y$ gauge symmetry, in which $U(1)$$_Y$ corresponds to a particle $B$ with weak hypercharge $Y$. $SU(2)$$_L$ corresponds to particles $W$$_\alpha$ ($\alpha$ = 1, 2, 3) with weak isospin $T$ and only left-handed chiral particles. The electroweak force which unifies the electromagnetism and the weak interaction as a Yang-Mills field is represented by the group $SU(2)$$_L$ x $U(1)$$_Y$, mathematically. In SM, the $Z$$^0$ boson and the photon ($\ga$) are given by: 

\begin{equation}
\left(\begin{array}{c}\gamma \\ Z^{0}\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{cc}\cos \theta_{\mathrm{W}} & \sin \theta_{\mathrm{W}} \\ -\sin \theta_{\mathrm{W}} & \cos \theta_{\mathrm{W}}\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}B \\ W_{3}\end{array}\right)
\end{equation}
where $\theta_{\mathrm{W}}$ is the weak mixing angle. 

The charged massive bosons $W$$^\pm$ are given by $W$$_1$ and $W$$_2$:


\begin{equation}
W^{\pm}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(W_{1} \mp i W_{2}\right)
 \end{equation}

$SU(3)$ corresponds to eight vector fields $A$$^\alpha$($\alpha$ = 1, 2, ...,8) representing gluon fields, which are vector gauge bosons that carry the colour charge of the strong interaction and mediate between quarks in QCD.
The Higgs boson, unlike all other known bosons such as the photon, is a scalar boson and has a non-zero average value in vacuum. It is resulted from the process of spontaneous symmetry breaking. The Higgs mechanism explains the generation of the property "mass" for gauge bosons. At a critical temperature, the Higgs field introduces a vacuum expectation value that causes spontaneous symmetry breaking during interactions, leads the bosons it interacts with acquire masses. A Yukawa coupling is used in the SM to describe the interaction between the Higgs field and fundamental fermions, explain the generation of the masses of fermions. 



This chapter therefore focuses on the present SM, various extensions and variants of the SM that have been proposed by theoretical physicists are explored in Section.\ref{sec:2.2}.

\subsubsection{Quantum chromodynamics}
\label{sec:2.1.1}

QCD is the theory of the strong interaction between quarks and gluons, and it is a fundamental component of the SM of particle physics. Satisfying the $SU(3)$ symmetry group invariant, QCD is a non-abelian gauge theory. Over the years, QCD has collected a huge body of experimental evidence, proved that it has been a successful application from a quantum field theory.

The Lagrangian of QCD can be expressed as:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{QCD}}=\bar{\psi}_{i}\left(i \gamma^{\mu}\left(D_{\mu}\right)_{i j}-m \delta_{i j}\right) \psi_{j}-\frac{1}{4} G_{\mu \nu}^{a} G_{a}^{\mu \nu}
\end{equation}
where $\psi_{i}$ is the quark field in the fundamental representation of the $SU(3)$ gauge group, indexed by $i$ and $j$ running from 1 to 3; $m$ corresponds to the quark mass; the $\gamma^{\mu}$ are Dirac matrices relating the spinor representation to the vector representation of the Lorentz group.

$D$$_{\mu}$ is defined as the gauge covariant derivative:

\begin{equation}
\left(D_{\mu}\right)_{i j}=\partial_{\mu} \delta_{i j}-i g_s\left(T_{a}\right)_{i j} \mathcal{A}_{\mu}^{a}
\end{equation}
which couples the quark field with a coupling strength $g$$_s$ to the gluon fields via the infinitesimal $SU(3)$ generators $T$$_{a}$. By including the Gell-Mann matrices $\lambda _{a}$ (a=1...8), an explicit representation of $T$$_{a}$ is defined by $T$$_{a}$=$\lambda _{a}$/2.

The gauge invariant gluon field strength tensor $G$$_{\mu \nu}^{a}$ is given by:
\begin{equation}
G_{\mu \nu}^{a}=\partial_{\mu} \mathcal{A}_{\nu}^{a}-\partial_{\nu} \mathcal{A}_{\mu}^{a}+g_s f^{a b c} \mathcal{A}_{\mu}^{b} \mathcal{A}_{\nu}^{c}
\end{equation}

where $\mathcal{A}$$_{\mu}^{\alpha}$ are the gluon fields, indexed by $a$, $b$ and $c$ running from 1 to 8; $f$$^{a b c}$ are the structure constants of $SU(3)$. The coupling strength $g$$_s$ can be referred to strong coupling constant $\alpha_{s}$:

\begin{equation}
\alpha_{s}=\frac{g_{s}^{2}}{4 \pi}
\end{equation}


There are some salient properties that QCD exhibits:
\begin{description}
\item[Colour confinement] \mbox{} \\
	This is a consequence of the force between two colour-charged particles that can not be isolated in a condition that below the Hagedorn temperature of approximately 2 terakelvin. To separate two quarks in a hadron, extremely high energy is required, leading to the creation of a quark-antiquark pair that formed a pair of hadrons rather than a single hadron. In addition, glueballs which are formed only of gluons are colourless and also consistent with confinement, causing difficulty in identification in experiments. 
	
	
	

\item[Asymptotic freedom and the running coupling] \mbox{} \\
	This is a feature of QCD that demonstrates the strong interactions between quarks and gluons become asymptotically weaker as the energy scale of them increases and the corresponding length scale decreases. This is opposite to the behaviour of colour-charged particles at low energies where the confinement of quarks and gluons exhibits. At high energy, the coupling decreases logarithmically as a function of momentum transfer $Q$:

		\begin{equation}
		\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}\left(Q^{2}\right) \stackrel{\text { def }}{=} \frac{g_{\mathrm{s}}^{2}\left(Q^{2}\right)}{4 \pi} \approx \frac{1}{\beta_{0} \ln \left(Q^{2} / \Lambda^{2}\right)}
		\end{equation}
		
where $\beta_{0}$ is a one-loop beta function in QCD and has the dependence of the coupling parameter $g$$_\mathrm{s}$. The quantity $\Lambda$ is referred to QCD scale that is measured in processes where the strong coupling constant and other measurable vary with momentum transfer $Q$.
However, this is only effective at leading order (LO). By including higher order terms, the calculation expanded in order of $\alpha_{s}$ resulted in more complexity and less significance as the scale of $Q$ increases. On the other hand, as $Q$ tends to be infinite large, the coupling strength becomes zero thus the behaviours of quarks are asymptotically free. These variation of coupling $\alpha_{s}$ under the different scales of energy in QCD is described as the running coupling.



%\item[Chiral symmetry breaking] \mbox{} \\
%	There are no known phase transition lines separating these two properties; confinement is dominant in the lower energy scales, but, as energy increases, asymptotic freedom becomes dominant.
	
\end{description}

The calculation of matrix element in QCD can be rather complex as more and more perturbative contributions are considered, which requires the application of complicated integrals over a large number of variables. A Feynman diagram is used as a representation of the expressions of these integrals pictorially and an improvement of undertaking the critical calculations.

\end{figure}

With more interactions points involved in, more complicated the calculations become. The effects of self-interactions between particles themselves can happen by producing a virtual particle which is restricted by the uncertainty principle, represented as a loop in a Feynman diagram. The accuracy of the calculation has dependency on the coupling $\alpha_{s}$ and is contributed to a fraction at each order. By including an infinite number of virtual particles, the calculations are led to divergent and infinite.

A set of techniques named renormalization are employed in solving the infinities showed up in the calculations, by which the infinite self-interactions are parametrised by re-scaling them as finite values to compensate the effects. The ultraviolet (UV) divergence arises when considering the contributions from extremely high-energy interactions, leading to integrals that tend to infinity. To manage this, the concept of the renormalization scale ($\mu_R$) is employed. The renormalization scale acts as a threshold, beyond which the effects of these high-energy contributions are 'normalized' or adjusted, ensuring that the calculations remain physically meaningful and finite. In contrast, the factorization scale ($\mu_F$) addresses a different aspect of divergence in QCD. This scale is concerned with the behaviour of interactions at very low, or infinitesimal, energies. As the energy approaches zero, integrals can again diverge, posing a problem for accurate computations. The factorization scale is thus introduced to regulate these low-energy contributions, separating the long-distance (or low-energy) effects from the short-distance (or high-energy) ones. This allows for a more controlled and precise approach in calculating the dynamics of quarks and gluons in various energy regimes.




However, it is imperative to emphasize that not all QCD phenomena are amenable to perturbative treatment. The transition to low-energy regimes results in a substantial increase in $\alpha_{s}$, heralding the dominance of non-perturbative effects. These effects are essential for understanding phenomena such as quark confinement and chiral symmetry breaking, with the former ensuring that quarks and gluons are perpetually bound within hadrons, and the latter influencing the masses of light quarks through spontaneous symmetry breaking. Such non-perturbative facet of QCD affects the modelling dependence in the analysis later on. A meticulous consideration of these non-perturbative aspects is studied in the Chapter~\ref{sec:5}, ensuring that our models are both accurate and reliable.


\subsection{Physics beyond the Standard Model}
\label{sec:2.2}
%\subsubsection{$H^\prime$}
%\label{sec:2.2.2}

%Many extensions of the SM predict the existence of new heavy Higgs-boson-like particles. 2HDMs are a wide set of models in which the couplings scale with Yukawa couplings thus leads to a relatively small branching ratio of the scale $H$ or pseudoscalar $A$ to gluons~\cite{Harlander:2013qxa}. New particles that decay into photons are also predicted by BSM and have a branching ratio to gluons.  Besides, some classes of models predicted the new particle decaying into photons with a branching ratio to gluons, where the relative branching ratio of photons to gluons is model-dependent. Models with new heavy fermions through scalar decays to gluons are also exist~\cite{PhysRevLett.116.150001,Agashe:2020wph,Curtin:2013fra}.
%
%The motivation of a model-independent di-gluon resonances is that the \mjj background is dominated by valence quark scattering at high energy, which leads gluon tagging particularly effective. At higher energy, there is higher jet constituent multiplicity that makes gluon tagging becomes more effective, thus the search in this analysis could gain the most from gluon tagging.
%
%For this analysis, a high mass simulated $SU(3)$ singlet scalar $H^\prime$ decaying into a pair of gluons is used. The physical width in practice is set to be narrow to be model-dependent and thus the \mjj width is set by the detector resolution.

%\subsubsection{String}
%%\label{sec:2.2.1}
%
%
%A mathematical framework named string theory has contributed to a variety of problems in the SM such as the existence of gravity, it offers a unified description of particle physics and gravity. String theory handles point-like particles as one-dimensional objects called strings and demonstrates the behaviours of these strings propagating through time and space. By regarding particles as infinitesimal vibrating strings, the charge, mass, and other properties of them are determined by the vibration or twist of the strings. A dynamical object called brane is employed to generalize the representation of a point particle to higher dimensions such that a string can be regarded as a brane of dimension one and can propagate through time and space under the principles of quantum mechanics. Among them, a so-called Dirichlet membrane (D-brane) is widely used as the open strings satisfy the Dirichlet boundary conditions~\cite{Antoniadis:2000ena,Cremades:2002qm,Antoniadis:2002qm}.
%
%In this analysis, we consider type-II string theory~\cite{StringBook} which includes a D-brane localized in $p$ + 3 partial dimension: D$p$-brane, compactified on a six-dimensional torus. The choice of the string mass scale $M_s$ is to be smaller than the 4-dimensional Planck scale to keep the coupling small, at the expense of introducing 9 - $p$ large transverse dimensions felt only by gravity. Only the fundamental string scale in the TeV range is what this analysis is interested in~\cite{Cullen:2000ef}.
%
%
%By considering the main subprocesses in dijet production that are independent of the details of the compactification. Amplitudes, which include 2$\to$2 scattering processes involving two gluons and two quarks, or four gluons,  are independent of the details of the compactification such as the configuration of branes~\cite{Lust:2008qc}. This model independence makes it possible to compute the string corrections to QCD dijet processes.

\subsubsection{Kaluza-Klein Graviton}
In particle physics, Kaluza–Klein theory (KK theory)~\cite{Klein:1926tv} is a significant concept that served as a classical unified field theory, attempts to unify gravitation and electromagnetism by proposing the existence of a fifth dimension, beyond the conventional four spacetime dimensions.  An intriguing aspect of this model is the KK gravitons, while gravitons are hypothetical elementary particles that mediate the force of gravity in quantum field theories, the KK gravitons are a set of massive excitations of the graviton in these extra spatial dimensions, exhibit enhanced coupling with the SM, surpassing the expected Planck scale limitations, makes their production and subsequent decay at colliders of interest. 

Within this theoretical framework, the Randall-Sundrum (RS1)~\cite{Randall:1999ee} model stands out due to its distinctive incorporation of an extra dimension. It posits a five-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime, where our observable universe is represented by a four-dimensional boundary or brane. Crucially, RS1 features an extra, compactified spatial dimension between two such branes. The gravitational interactions become weaker as one moves away from the TeV brane, offering a solution to the hierarchy problem. This warping of spacetime results in the graviton having a spectrum of massive KK modes, influencing its interactions in our observable universe.


While still theoretical, searching for these KK gravitons, especially at high-energy physics experiments like those at the LHC, offers an unique perspective on the effects of extra dimensions and thereby deepen our understanding of the universe's fundamental nature. Due to their enhanced couplings with the SM, the KK gravitons can decay into any pair of SM particles, with the decay rates being largely determined by the masses of these particles. Among these, the gluon-gluon channel often dominates because of the large colour charge of gluons and the large number of available gluon states.

The graviton sector within the RS1 model is fully determined by two key parameters: $m_{KK}$ and $k/\overline{M}_{PI}$, where $m_{KK}$ is the mass of KK graviton, $k$ is a scale of order the Planck scale, ${M}_{PI}$ is effective four-dimensional (reduced) Planck scale.


\subsubsection{Quantum Black Hole}
\label{sec:2.2.3}

Quantum Black Hole (QBH), also called micro black holes, is regarded as hypothetical mini (less than a solar mass unit) black hole that dominated by quantum mechanical effects at sizes close to the Planck length~\cite{10.1093/mnras/152.1.75}. Some hypotheses predict that QBH could be produced at energies as low as the TeV range, which can be generated in particle accelerators such as the LHC, and can be observed through the particles that are emitted by the process of Hawking radiation~\cite{Hawking:1975vcx}. Theoretical calculations indicate that as black holes decrease in size, their rate of evaporation accelerates. This phenomenon leads to an abrupt release of particles, akin to a sudden eruption, when a micro black hole approaches its final stages of evaporation.


In the simplest scenario, the decay of QBH via Hawking radiation can be approximately described as isotropic decay to a many-particle final state.  The threshold of quantum-gravity energy scale $M_D \equiv\left[M_{P l}^2 /\left(8 \pi r_c^n\right)\right](1 /(2+n))$ is set to be well below the 
the actual thermal black hole production threshold for gravitational interactions so that two-body states in final states are the dominant, a resonance-like result is expected in predominantly two-body final states as jets closed to $M_D$. Such isotropic final states is aimed as probes of quantum gravitational effects in this dijet analysis.



%\subsubsection{Graviton}
%\label{sec:2.2.4}
%
%Graviton is at the heart of arguably the biggest challenge in theoretical physics, over decades, physicists have struggled to combine Einstein’s theory of gravity, known as General Relativity, with quantum field theory.
%Graviton is believed to be the carrier of the gravitational field, which means it is the hypothetical elementary particle that mediates the gravitational interactions in the theories of quantum gravity. Graviton is presumed to be massless due to the long range of gravitational interaction and propagates forces and energies at the speed of light as photons.
%There are difficulties in the detection of individual gravitons because of the extremely low cross-section of gravitational interaction with matter. Although gravity affects all particles, its strength at the scale of quarks is predicted to be 10$^{-41}$ relative to electromagnetic force. However, observations such as LIGO and Virgo interferometer have successfully detected cosmic gravitational waves in 2016 and were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2017.
%Despite the fact that so far no individual graviton has been detected, these experiments still might probe some properties of the graviton. Recent observations of gravitational waves have put an upper bound of  6$\times$10$^{-32}$ eV/c$^2$ on the mass of a graviton.

\section{The ATLAS Experiment}
\label{sec:3}

\subsection{The Large Hadron Collider}
\label{sec:3.1}

The LHC, built by European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) located in Geneva, Switzerland, is the largest circular particle accelerator in the world. The goal of it is to probe the various theoretical predictions made by physicists.
  
It consists superconducting magnets that construct a 27-kilometer ring lying in the tunnel under the ground. Inside the LHC, two beams made of protons or ions are accelerated to extreme high speed in opposite direction in individual vacuum pipes then made into collision by a strong magnetic field within the structures.

The LHC is the last section of the CERN accelerator complex where a series of machines accelerates the particles to increasingly higher and higher energies. The highest energies of beams are reached at the LHC.


 \begin{figure}[htb] 
 	\centering  
 		\includegraphics[width=16cm]{./fig/2022.png}
 		\caption{The CERN accelerator complex}
\end{figure}
 

 Seven detectors are placed around four collision points in the collider. Different types of particles are accelerated according to the research, the main beams are protons, but the LHC also run beams of heavy ions as lead–lead collision or proton-lead collisions.
 
 The energy of particles is increased by a series of processes before being injected into the main accelerator. For a proton-proton collision, negative hydrogen ions are generated by the linear particle accelerator Linac4 at 160 MeV then injected into the Proton Synchrotron Booster, where protons are obtained by stripping electrons away from the atom and accelerated to 2 GeV. After entered the Proton Synchrotron the energy of the protons is 26 GeV, and then their energies are increased in Super Proton Synchrotron to 450 GeV before they are finally injected into the main ring. 

  
One of the characteristics that defines the power of an accelerator is the centre-of-mass energy, which represents the total momentum of the system and thus indicates the total mass of potential new particles as well as probes the internal structure of known particles under the law of energy invariant within the system. In 2010, the first collisions were made at an energy of 3.5 TeV each beam, later in 2018, an energy of 6.5 TeV per beam was achieved, resulted in the centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV where the protons moved at more than 99.9\% speed of light. It took less than 90 $\mu$s for photons to go through the whole LHC ring. 

Other quantities such as luminosity, denoted as $\mathcal{L}$, also represents the performance of an accelerator. It is the rate of interactions during a certain period of time and can be expressed as:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}=\frac{N^2 f_{r e v}}{4 \pi \sigma_x \sigma_y} 
\end{equation}
where $N$ is the number of particles in a bunch, in the case that a beam has Gaussian distribution and has brunches crossing frecuency $f_{rev}$. $\sigma_x$ and $\sigma_y$ denote as transverse beam widths in the x- and y-plane. The luminosity takes the units of cm$^{-2}$·s$^{-1}$.

The total number of physics events detected can be express as:

\begin{equation}
N_{\text {event }}=\sigma_{\text {event }} \cdot \int \mathcal{L} d t \equiv \sigma_{\text {event }} \cdot L
\end{equation}

where $L$ is the integrated luminosity with respect to time, $\sigma_{\text {event }}$ is referred to the cross section of a specific physics process. The integrated luminosity takes the units of cm$^{-2}$ which equals to the unit femtobarn (fb).

 At the LHC, thousands of magnets around the accelerator are operated at a very low temperature of $-$271.3\textcelsius \ to maintain its superconducting state which allow them to conduct electricity without loss of energy. Hence, a system of liquid helium is used for cooling the accelerator and supply services.

Besides, superconducting radio frequency cavities which resonate electromagnetic fields are employed to accelerate the protons. Instead of having continuous beams, the protons are made into bunches, so that the collisions are taken place at discrete intervals between two beams with 115 billion protons per bunch at the frequency of 25 ns.


\subsection{The ATLAS detector}
\label{sec:3.2}

The ATLAS detector~\cite{PERF-2007-01} is the largest volume detector ever constructed for general-purpose particle research at the LHC. It has the shape of a cylinder with 44 meters long, 7000 tonnes in weight and 25 meters in diameter, sitting in a cavern underground. It is designed to collect evidence of the properties of SM and search for new predictions made by particle physics beyond the SM.

To record the energy, momentum and trajectory of particles after collisions, the detector consisting of 6 different detecting subsystems  placed in layers surrounding the interaction point to measure them individually and effectively. 

 \begin{figure}[htb] 
	\centering  
	\includegraphics[width=15cm]{./fig/atlas.png}
	\caption{Cut-away view of the ATLAS detector}
	\label{Fig.atlas}
\end{figure}
An overall layout of the ATLAS detector is shown in Figure~\ref{Fig.atlas}.

\subsubsection{Inner detector}
\label{sec:3.2.1}

Charged particles above a certain \pt~threshold are detected by the ATLAS Inner Detector (ID) which immersed in a 2 T solenoidal field, covered the pseudorapidity range \abseta < 2.5.
Appearing as tracks in the ID, an excellent momentum resolution as well as both primary and secondary vertex of them are provided by the ID.  Within the range \abseta < 2.0,  electron identification is also provided.

The layout of the ID is shown in Figure~\ref{Fig.id} in cylindrical coordinate: $r=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$, where $x$-axis alongside the LHC ring and $y$-axis is perpendicular to the $x$-axis.
\begin{figure}[htb] 
	\centering  
	\includegraphics[width=13cm]{./fig/id.png}	\caption{Cut-away view of the ATLAS ID. Sensors and structural elements traversed by a charged track of 10 GeV \pt~in the barrel inner detector along with their envelopes in $r$.}
	\label{Fig.id}
\end{figure}

A cylindrical container around the ID has a length of 3512 mm each way and a radius of 1150 mm, tracks of 10 GeV traverse the sensors and structural elements in the barrel and end-cap regions, respectively.

Within the inner region, a series of discrete space points provided by the silicon pixel detector and stereo pairs of silicon microstrip semiconductor tracking (SCT) layers gives high-resolution pattern recognition abilities. By increasing radial distances, the transition radiation tracker (TRT) provides extra pattern recognition and momentum resolution capabilities.

\begin{description}
 \item[The pixel detector] \mbox{} \\
A series of high-granularity measurements is provided by the pixel detector~\cite{PIX-2018-001} which is composed of the innermost sub-detector of the ID, it is designed as close to the interaction point as possible. Three sub-sections: two end-cap perpendicular to the beam axis and a barrel alongside the beam axis as a concentric cylinder with four layers (average radii of 33.25, 50.5, 88.5 and 122.5 mm, respectively) in it. 

The innermost pixel layer (or B-layer, IBL) is essential to b-tagging performance and supersymmetry searches as it cover the full acceptance of short-lived particles such as B hadrons and $\tau$ leptons from the beginning of Run-2 to enhance the measurement of the secondary vertex. Besides, a new readout sensor and chip responsible for higher radiation damage and higher hit rate, respectively, is employed in the IBL compared to the other three layers in the barrel region. A new  n-in-n planar and 3D silicon sensors with hit efficiency of greater than 97\% is developed as well. The better impact parameter resolution is achieved by reducing the pixel size of the chip down to 50 $\times$ 250 $\mu$m$^2$.  Around 80 million readout sections counting them all provide the great  hit resolution of 10 $\mu$m in radius plane and 115 $\mu$m alongside the z-axis in the pixel detector.

 \item[The semiconductor tracker] \mbox{} \\
 Surrounding the pixel detector is the SCT which encompasses silicon based semiconductor sensing components in barrel and end-cap geometries. Four silicon microstrip layers, located at radii of 300, 373, 447 and 520 mm, in the barrel region of the SCT provide high granularity points. The mean size of each strip pitch is 80 $\mu$m for the rectangular barrel sensors as daisy-chained with 6 cm-long. For the end-cap sensors, nine disks cover \abseta  < 2.5 are chosen. As a results, there are thus 768 readout strips with 6.36 $\times$ 6.40  cm$^2$ in size in total, with additional two strips at the edge of the sensor. 6.1 m$^2$ of silicon detectors with 6.2 million readout channels as a whole integrated the SCT. 
 
 \item[The transition radiation tracker] \mbox{} \\
 The outermost layer of the ID is the TRT which encompasses polyimide drift(straw) tubes that designed to enable as much less wall thickness and material as possible while maintaining the good experimental properties. With 4 mm in diameter and 150 cm in length, 73 layers of 144 cm alongside the beam with 50 thousands tubes and 37 cm tubes consisting 160 tubes planes in the end-cap with 320 thousands radial tubes.
 
 The xenon-based gas filled up in a given tube provides the track hit of a particle as it ionized as the emitting electrons drifting to the center wire of the tube volume. An average of 36 hits per charged-particle track is given by the TRT, 
 The resulting electrical signals are obtained by converting the drifting charge currents. In total 420 thousands of electronics channels in which a good spatial resolution and drift-time measurement are provided by the TRT, enhancing the precision measurements of momentum in the ID.  
 

\end{description}

\subsubsection{Calorimeters}
\label{sec:3.2.2}

Outside of the ID lies the ATLAS calorimeters system which is designed to obtain the energy lost of the particles that travel through the detector components. Multiple layers of high-density material are placed to consume the energy of the incoming particles inside the materials and stop them from further moving.  An “active” medium is left inside the layers that allows experimental physicists measure the energy of those particles.

Two types of calorimeters are employed in the ATLAS calorimeters system: the energy of electrons and photons are measured by the electromagnetic calorimeters as they create reaction with matter. Hadronic showers that created by the interaction between hadrons and atomic nuclei, are sampled by the hadronic calorimeters. Muons and neutrinos can not be stopped by the calorimeters as they interact only weak force but the track footprints could be seem in the calorimeters. The layout of the calorimeters is shown in Figure~\ref{Fig.calo1}.

\begin{figure}[htb] 
	\centering  
	\includegraphics[width=15cm]{./fig/calo1.jpg}	\caption{Outline of the ATLAS Run 2 trigger and data-acquisition system.}
	\label{Fig.calo1}
\end{figure}

The electromagnetic (EM) calorimeter covers a range of  \abseta < 3.2 by combining the one barrel and two end-cap modules as cylindrical cryostat, with an outer radius of 2.25 m, an end-cap thickness of 0.632 m and a length of 3.17 m. The hadronic calorimeter covers the central barrel region of \abseta < 1.0 and two extended barrels in a region of 0.8 < \abseta < 1.7. with a radius of 2.28 m at the inside and 4.25 m at the outside. Figure~\ref{Fig.calo2} demonstrates the positions of the end-cap of the calorimeters including the EM and Hadronic calorimeters.



\begin{figure}[htb] 
	\centering  
	\includegraphics[width=15cm]{./fig/calo2.png}	\caption{Cut-away view of an end-cap cryostat of the ATLAS calorimeter system.}
	\label{Fig.calo2}
\end{figure}



\begin{description}
	\item[The electromagnetic calorimeter] \mbox{} \\
The EM calorimeter that surrounding the ATLAS ID is designed for the high-granularity measurements of the energy of photons, electrons and hadrons with Liquid Argon (LAr) sandwiched between the multiple layers ionised. It converts the incoming particles into electric currents by absorbing the energy of these particles as they interact with the metal with the bremsstrahlung phenomenon. A pair of electron-positron produced by an electron radiation in the EM calorimeter can initiate further electron-positron pairs (as showers) until the energy of the particles fall below the certain threshold, the dominate process thus become ionisation in the LAr where drifting electrons are produced. Furthermore, the missing transverse energy can be obtained by subtracting the total energy of the known particles, which contributes to the analysis of neutrinos and new particles.

At -184 \textcelsius~where the argon exists in liquid form, the calorimeter is kept as the cables that transverse electronic signals are sealed in vacuum and connected to the warmer area where located the readout system.




\item[The hadronic calorimeter] \mbox{} \\
Surrounded the EM calorimeter, lies the tile hadronic calorimeter where hadrons that contain strong force thus could not fully deposit their relatively large energy in the EM calorimeter are absorbed by the tile calorimeter. Steel and plastic scintillating tiles are placed in layers in order to record the trajectories of incoming particles as hadronic showers are formed by the interactions of the particles with the materials and emitting particles continue interacting with materials in the hadronic calorimeter and more particles are produced in steel layers. On the other hand, photons are produced by the plastic scintillators where electric currents are gained according to the energy of the particle.

By enveloping the EM calorimeter, a hadronic shower that contained EM showers can be fully absorbed by the great thickness in the hadronic calorimeter. Around 420 thousands of plastic scintillator tiles are placed in sync, leading a weight of 2.9 thousands tonne in total.

\begin{figure}[htb] 
	\centering  
	\includegraphics[width=11cm]{./fig/tile11.png}	\caption{A schematic view of a tile calorimeter components of optical readout tiles and scintillating tiles.}
	\label{Fig.Tile1}
\end{figure}

As illustrated in Figure~\ref{Fig.Tile1},  photomultiplier tubes (PMT) are placed around the outer radii of the tile calorimeter and connected with wavelength-shifting fibres by which scintillation light is transferred. Projective geometry is designed for the whole readout system as the energy of most hadronic showers is deposited in the first or last two layers.  Though the coarser granularity of the readout cells of hadronic calorimeter has been compared to the EM calorimeter, the hadronic calorimeter is qualified for the measurement of transverse momentum and jet reconstruction.

In the forward regions, the hadronic calorimeters are integrated with LAr calorimeters due to higher radiation exposition compared to the barrel regions. There are two calorimeters that were developed to tackle such issue: the hadronic end-cap calorimeter (HEC) that covers 1.5 < \abseta < 3.2 and the forward calorimeter (FCal) that covers 3.1 < \abseta < 4.9.

The HEC located further beside the EM end-cap calorimeter has two wheels in each end-cap.  LAr is used for filling up 8.5 mm between copper layers in the HEC, by which the active medium is provided. The readout electrodes are provided in separate drift zones in order to secure the stability of the whole system.  The FCal has three wheels placed alongside the z-direction: one electromagnetic layer (FCal 1) and two hadronic layers (FCal 2 and FCal 3). LAr is also used as an active medium in all of the layers. As for the absorber, copper is employed in FCal 1 as it has heat removal properties.  Tungsten is used in both FCal 2 and FCal 3 in order to constrain the lateral spread of hadronic showers. 
\end{description}


\subsubsection{Muon spectrometer}
\label{sec:3.2.3}

The muon spectrometer (MS), specially designed for the muon detection is located in the outermost section of the ATLAS in order to provide sufficient measurement of high-momentum muons which are almost "invisible" to the ID and calorimeters due to little energy deposit when traveled through the them. By deflecting the trajectories of muons, the MS employs the magnetic field by a barrel toroid magnet system in \abseta < 1.4 and end-cap toriod systems in 1.6 < \abseta < 2.7. 

Four subsections of the MS: add up to 4000 separate muon chambers. Thin Gap Chambers (TGC) and Resistive Plate Chambers (RPC) account for triggering and the second coordinate measurement of muons. TGC is set at the end of the detector whereas RPC which provides 5,000 V/mm electric field is placed in the central region. Monitored Drift Tubes (MDT) is designed for the curve of muon tracks measurement with fine tube resolution of 80 $\mu$m. Cathode Strip Chambers (CSC) accounts for measuring coordinates precisely located at ends of detector with a fine resolution of 60 $\mu$m. Figure~\ref{Fig.ms} demonstrates the MS with all four subsections. In total three separate points within the muon trajectory are measured to reconstruct the momentum of the muon.


\begin{figure}[htb] 
	\centering  
	\includegraphics[width=14cm]{./fig/muon.jpg}	\caption{Cut-away view of the ATLAS Muons Spectrometer with subsections labeled.}
	\label{Fig.ms}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Trigger and data acquisition}
\label{sec:3.2.4}

The ATLAS trigger and data acquisition system is a crucial component of the experiment, designed to manage the immense volume of data generated by the LHC. Given the context of approximately 1 billion proton-proton collisions occur per second and an integrated luminosity of 140 \ifb, the role of this system becomes even more critical. However, many of these collisions are unlikely to produce characteristics of interest. As a result, large numbers of events can be discarded without affecting the search for new physics. The trigger and data acquisition systems are introduced to eliminate the irrelevant data so that only events of suitable quality and quantity are recorded.

\begin{figure}[htb] 
	\centering  
	\includegraphics[width=16cm]{./fig/dq.png}	\caption{illustration of the ATLAS  Run 2 trigger and data acquisition system.}
	\label{Fig.dq}
\end{figure}

During the year of 2015-2018, the trigger system in ATLAS selected significant events in a two staged process, as illustrated in Figure~\ref{Fig.dq}: The first-level (L1) trigger is implemented on hardware, and reduced event rates from 40 MHz to 100 kHz in less than 2.5 $\mu$s right after the data happened. Working with the electrical information provided by the calorimeters and the MS, the L1 trigger employs custom-made electronics to filter and store the events in the readout sections as buffers before passing them to the High-Level trigger (HLT)~\cite{TRIG-2016-01}. Certain physics objects such as photons, jets and leptons are identified in the L1 trigger, in which energy depositions of electrons and photons in the EM calorimeter and jets in the hadronic calorimeter are provided. Information of tracks in high-momentum muons is recorded in the layers of the MS and forwarded to the L1 trigger.

The events are further reduced from 100 kHz to 1 kHz in merely 250 microseconds by the second level trigger: HLT. Based on the offline software, the HLT utilize fast selection algorithms to analyse and reject events in the early stage, resulting in better precision and intense CPU usage of about 1.6 GB per second.  The accepted data from the HLT will be passed to permanent storage at CERN via Data Logger~\cite{ATL-SOFT-PUB-2021-001}.

\fancyhead[C]{Jets in ATLAS}
\section{Jets in ATLAS}
\label{sec:4}


In the LHC, a large number of quarks and gluons are produced during the inelastic proton-proton collisions, resulting in jets. These collimated outcome particles are hadronised because of colour confinement in the QCD process. As a result of this, only colour-neutral jets clustered by particles can be seen in the detector.

The information of jets is crucial to most of the analysis such as the measurements of the SM particles and searches for the BSM phenomena. Good qualities of jets, for example the high efficiency of jet reconstruction, jet energy calibration including energy scale and energy resolution, are thus important to the analysis.

\input{Texfiles/jet}


%  Since the momentum is conserved throughout the showering and the hadronization process, a parton with large momentum will thus product particles which also have a signification fraction of their momenta in that direction. These final-state hadrons can be grouped into a spray of particles in the same region of the detector. A jet can thus be form by gathering the final-state particles and their energies into a single object. The finding of a jet goes back to a seminal work done by G. Sterman and S. Weinberg [68]. No standardized procedure for the jet finding algorithms exist, but there are a set of properties considered to be important [69]:

%Jets in ATLAS can be defined using a variety of objects. Truth-particle jets are formed using stable particles with lifetimes longer than 10 ps excluding muons and neutrinos from the event generator. Track jets are built from charged particle tracks in inner-detector. They are insensitive to the effect of pile-up. And last the calorimeter jets which are used most commonly by analysis, use the topocluster for reconstructions [70].
%In this chapter, two algorithms employed in the ATLAS will be discussed following the reconstruction. A brief introduction to the jet calibration will also be presented.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:7}

From 2015 to 2018, the proton-proton collision at the LHC have achieved an unprecedented centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV, with a total integrated luminosity of 140 \ifb that have been recorded by the ATLAS experiment. Such huge amount of collision data allows scientists to test models beyond the SM in a more efficient way, leading to a deeper understanding of physics beyond the SM.

This thesis presents a search for new resonances that potentially decay into a pair of jets using the data collected by the ATLAS detector during 2015-2018. Resonances predicted by the BSM can decay into quarks and/or gluons. The sensitivity of the search could be significantly increased by introducing jet taggers. This study leverages the extensive dataset recorded between 2015 and 2018 to extend the taggers' applicability to high-energy jets. Two distinct jet tagging methods are explored: a tagger centred on the charged-particle jet constituent multiplicity (\ntrk), and a BDT-based tagger, which integrates various individual jet substructure observables. 

The matrix method is adopted to estimate the distribution shapes of the tagging variables for quark- and gluon-jets. This entails combining information from samples enriched with quark- and gluon-jets, acquired from a selection of dijet events characterized by jet \pt~ranging from 500 GeV to 2 TeV. The considered variables exhibit a satisfactory agreement with the MC simulations, with discrepancies relative to data measurements being less than 25\% across various defined regions. 

The BDT-tagger demonstrates superior performance over the \ntrk-only tagger in distinguishing quark-jets from gluon-jets within the jet \pt~range of 500 GeV to 1200 GeV. Above this range, the performance of the two taggers becomes comparable. The evaluation of tagger performance differences between data and MC samples is facilitated through the data-to-MC SFs. Four working points of 50\%, 60\%, 70\%, 80\% together with all systematics are provided so that analyses can use it based on their own interest. These factors are measured across varying jet-\pt~intervals, exhibiting a range from 0.92 to 1.02, with a cumulative uncertainty of approximately 20\%. The primary contributor to this uncertainty stems from divergent modelling choices within MC simulations, constituting approximately 18\% for both taggers. To account for variations between different MC generators, MC-to-MC SFs are also presented, ranging from 0.9 to 1.1 for the majority of MC samples.

The $q/g$ taggers developed in this study and the associated measurement of their SFs hold relevance for various analyses. These applications encompass SM measurements that rely on accurate jet origin identification, as well as BSM physics searches that can capitalize on heightened sensitivity to the presence of new particles. This thesis performs the searches on \mjj spectrum. Besides the general dijet search, events featuring jets recognized as either one or two gluon-jets are specifically examined. Benchmark models Graviton and QBH are tested. Because no significant excess in data are found, an upper limit is set to each model in 95\% CLs. In this analysis, a comprehensive summary of the lower limits on the signal masses for our benchmark models are given. For example, the observed lower limit set on Graviton mass is 3.81 TeV in untagged region, whereas in 1-$g$ tagged region the mass increases to 4.01 TeV and in 2-$g$ tagged region is 4.26 TeV. For QBH model,  the observed lower limit set on its mass is 9.88 TeV in untagged region, whereas in 1-$g$ tagged region the mass increases to 9.89 TeV and in 2-$g$ tagged region, the mass below 10.00 TeV are excluded at 95\% CL. The incorporation of gluon-tagging has been greatly enhanced by advancements in the gluon-jet tagging algorithm by 5\% for each gluon tagged, especially at high transverse momentum. This has notably improved the sensitivity, offering gains that extend beyond those anticipated from the mere increase in integrated luminosity.
